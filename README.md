# GitHub Time Capsule

## Overview

The GitHub Time Capsule project is a unique tool that allows users to create "time capsules" within a GitHub repository. These capsules are sealed until a specified future date, after which they can be opened to reveal their contents. The tool uses encryption to ensure that the contents remain secure until the designated date.

## Features

- **Sealed Capsules**: Create a sealed capsule with a specified opening date.
- **Secure Encryption**: The capsule's contents are encrypted using a secret key.
- **Future Proof**: Capsules cannot be opened before the specified date, ensuring the data remains a surprise.
- **Key Management**: A secret key is generated and provided to the user to decrypt the capsule when the time comes.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Wasserpuncher/github-time-capsule.git
   cd github-time-capsule
